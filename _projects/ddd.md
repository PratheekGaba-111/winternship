summary: Dopamine Driven Dashboard - Integrated performance and engagement analytics across all projects
---


## Project Overview

DDD is a comprehensive performance and engagement dashboard that provides real-time insights into user activity, progress, and achievements across the entire platform. Rather than being a standalone application, DDD is seamlessly integrated into all other projects (ViBe, Spandan, Peer Evaluation), providing a unified analytics experience that motivates and tracks user engagement through gamification and visual feedback.

## Key Features

- Real-time performance tracking and analytics
- User engagement metrics and visualization
- Gamification elements (achievements, streaks, levels)
- Progress indicators and milestones
- Interactive data visualizations and charts
- Personalized performance insights
- Motivational feedback and rewards system

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: React, TypeScript
- Backend: Express.js, Node.js
- Database: MongoDB
- Data Visualization: Chart.js / D3.js

## Integration Approach

DDD is embedded as a modular component within each project:
- **ViBe**: Tracks video engagement, completion rates, learning patterns
- **Spandan**: Monitors class participation, question responses, interaction frequency
- **Peer Evaluation**: Analyzes evaluation activity, feedback quality, review completeness

## Project Goals

1. Create unified dashboard for all user activities
2. Implement engaging gamification mechanics
3. Provide actionable insights on performance
4. Motivate continuous user engagement
5. Enable cross-project analytics and reporting
